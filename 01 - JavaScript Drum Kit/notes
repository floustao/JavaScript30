Learning about :

data-attributes
play() an <audio>
transition and transitionend (CSS)
add/remove/toggle class :
  jquery => addClass('playing');
  pure js => classList.add('playing');
keycode.info = website to know the keycode of each key (ex: 'a' = 65)
querySelector = one selection
querySelectorAll = all selections
-------------------------------

How does it work ? What is the JS trick ?

You push a key and it makes a sound and make some color
it adds class 'playing' which in the css file changes the border color for a few milliseconds.

> html structure :

1st part :
big div with class = keys
  sub divs with class key + data-key

2nd part :
<audio attached to data-keys as well

So it detects which key you type, and play the audio corresponding to the data-key associated.

keycode.info = website to know the keycode of each key (ex: 'a' = 65)
-------------------------------
<script>
let's add a micro (addEventListener)
on the window,
that starts with keydown (it could start with keyup)
and add a function

window.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
  console.log(e);
});

=> let's see in the console what e displays
=> detect keycode

e.keycode

=> let's set a constant audio that finds the html including the audio sound from the document

window.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
  const audio = document.querySelector(`audio[data-key = "${e.keycode}"]`);
  audio.play();
});

#attention concatenation avec guillemets differents

----------------------------
Let's add a stop if no keycode, meaning no audio !

if (!audio) return; => exit function

--------------------------------
can't playing over and over in succession
audio.currentTime = 0; => rewind from the start

------------------------------
Let's add some styling
class playing in css is ready to be added

1. select html you want
2. add class
jquery => addClass('playing');
pure js => classList.add('playing');

-------------------------------
Let's stop styling after time out:

transition is the important property in the CSS file here
Once the transition ends, we can remove the class 'playing'
When does teh transition end ?
in CSS we have 'transitionend' !

1. let's add an eventListener triggerred by transitionend to each key:

const keys = document.querySelectorAll('.key')
keys.forEach(key => key.addEventListener('transitionend', callback function))

callback = removeTransition = function to create before

2. Let's create that function

function removeTransition(e) {
  console.log(e)
};

=> all the TransitionEvent are displayed in console (4 borders, transform, and box-shadow)

Let's be specific to improve performance, we only want transform

function removeTransition(e) {
  if (e.propertyName !== 'transform') return; // skip it if it is not a transform
  console.log(e.propertyName);
};

=> on a bien la transition transform qui s'affiche
=> classList.remove('playing');

---------------------------------------
DRY code, how to refacto ?

=> inject all the logic in a function playSound

=> call playSound in the eventListener on window, at the end.
