What's new ?
------------

element.offSetTop
window.scrollY
element.offsetHeight

=> add & create CSS class fixed
=> add it to document.body so it can be reused.

=> The addition of the .fixed creates a weird jump
Because now the sub-element has some space to spread.
To fix this => add padding

when you make an element fixed, it no longer takes space in the doc => it is called refloat
=> add a padding of the element's height
