What's new ?
------------

SpeechSynthesisUtterance()
=> gathers all info about speech (languages, msg, rate, pitch, ..)

speechSynthesis
speechSynthesis.speak(utterance)
=> global variable to which you pass an utterance to speak :
=> It does not work yet because voice is null



# How to populate the voices ? List of voices is empty...

  .getVoices()
  'voiceschanged' event starts everytime you change the voice AND when the page initially loads

# How to make the voice speak ?
The voice will work once the voices are populated.
It is still voice: null but you can :
speechSynthesis.speak('Flo is a future king of development');

# How to filter voices ?
  Just filter before .map. You can filter by english voices for instance :
  .filter(voice => voice.lang.includes('en'))

# How to stop the voice from speaking ?
  .cancel() method on speechSynthesis
  Since we have one function that toogles speak/stop, we need to pass it an argument => true/false

# How to change argument on toggle ? To stop voice
  pass another function in eventListener:
  () => toggle(false)

  or use .bind(null, false)
