RESUME

Bahavior is different between string/numbers vs array

- If you update a string or a number, it will NOT reference back.
- If you update an array, it will always referece back !

# So how do you fix this ?
=> By making a copy of it

const array2 = [...array];

or

const array2 = Array.from(array)
