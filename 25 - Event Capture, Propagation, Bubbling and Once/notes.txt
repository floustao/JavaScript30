# why does a click in the middle display the 3 divs ?
  'Event capturing' goes top to bottom and THEN
  'bubbling' fires the triggers bottom to top
  So if you click on an element that is wrapped by a parent, it will bubble fires the element and then the parent too.

# How to inverse the order ?
  In eventListener by default capture is set to false
  If you do :
  .addEventListener('event', function(), {
    capture: true
  })

  It will inverse the behavior and fire from bottom to top

# How to avoid the triple display ?
  By stopping the bubbling with:
  .stopPropagation()

# So if you capture: true & stopPropagation => click on int and you fire ext

# How to unbid/allow one event only ? => once

  .addEventListener('event', function(), {
    once: true
  })
