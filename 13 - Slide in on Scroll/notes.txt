RESUME

img are by default :
opacity 0
translateX

addEventListener('scroll', )

You are overwhelmed with event while using scroll => to diminish the number of event => debounce()

properties window :
  window.scrollY => gives pixels scrolled down
  window.scroll(0, 0);  // reset the scroll position to the top left of the document.
  window.innerHeight => height of visible window (different than outerHeight which includes the tab, url part, ...)

property img :
  img.offsetTop => gives distance between top of image and top of its parent (here the parent is the window)
