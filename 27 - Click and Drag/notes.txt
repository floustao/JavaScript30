# What is the trick ?

  => once you click => select div and locate position of mouse
  => once you drag => translate the div by how many px you move the mouse
  => You will need mousedown, mouseleave, mouseup and mousemove

startX will be the position of the anchor
scrollLeft will be the position of the mouseup

# How to get position of mouse on page ?
  .pageX
  => fix it by substracting offsetLeft

# How to display what variable we are console logging ?
  console.log({var})
